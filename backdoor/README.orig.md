mini-vm
=======

A small, register-based virtual machine (bytecode interpreter) in C.


### How it works

Each bytecode instruction is 4 bytes long.

      0   1   2   3
    +---+---+---+---+
    | A | B | C | D |
    +---+---+---+---+

    A - Instruction ID. This is the index of the function in the function table you wish to call.
    B - Register #1. (usually the destination register)
    C - Register #2. (usually an argument source register)
    D - Register #3. (usually an argument source register)

Instead of the usual switch/case-based architecture most bytecode interpreters
use, I chose to go with a table of function pointers whose indices correspond
with particular instruction IDs.

An interpreter can be initialized by calling `initVMContext()` and supplying
the appropriate parameters.

The interpreter's state has to be advanced one instruction at a time by
by calling `stepVMContext()` repeatedly. In the example programs, this is
typically done with a simple `while` loop.

Termination is not accounted for by default. Adding a custom **halt**
instruction or some sort of status register are both plausible solutions.


### Build

 - On *nix platforms, just type `make` to build mini-vm as a static library. To build the examples, just type `make test` in each example's directory.
 - For Windows: An MSVC 2010 Project file is provided under `/msvc`. Double click on it to generate a solution file.


### Documentation

 - Look under the `/examples` folder to see examples of mini-vm in action.
 - Also worth reading: [the project's site][1]. The bytecode format and the structure of the VM are explained here.
